            <h5>Family, Friends and Places</h5>

            <p>Hi, my name is Melinda Shaw and it hasn't changed since birth. I was born at Virginia Mason Hospital in downtown Seattle (and so was my first child). I live with my husband, Andy, and we have two grown daughters, Chloe and Ella. Last fall, Andy and I got a puppy, Senator Lloyd Bentsen! My best friend, Christine, lives in Nantes, France. We met while my family was on sabbatical in France seven years ago. I try to go back every year. So far, so good!</p>

            <h5>Things I Love</h5>

            <p>I love to create things, those big and small, from remodeling kitchens and bathrooms to making jewelry. I also love a good cup of coffee in the morning, going to Barre class, travel-hacking (not exactly what it sounds like) to earn miles, and sipping cocktails my husband makes me. And, of course, I love good design.</p>

            <h5>Work Experience</h5>

            <p>I am the co-founder of the <a target="_blank" href="http://pscs.org">Puget Sound Community School</a>, an independent, federally recognized non-profit middle and high school in Seattle that has been flourishing since 1994. As the school's Administrative Director, I designed and implemented an administrative structure for the school that allowed it to not only survive financially but to thrive. The experiences I gained at the school have provided me a background in innovation, grassroots creativity, responding to challenges, and collaboration across ages.</p>
