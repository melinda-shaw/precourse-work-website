          <h5>Becoming a Web Developer</h5>

          <p>I've always loved fixing things, and to play and tinker with them to see how they work. I've worked in clothing design. I've remodeled an entire home, including the design of electrical, plumbing and sprinkler systems. I've co-created and designed a highly successful independent school. Years ago, I dabbled in HTML to create websites for the school, then for a self-help company, and for individuals. Each time I did this, I felt like I was a master designer. A few strokes on the keyboard, save, then enter, and WOW, look at that. I made that! A few more strokes and now it does that. Cool! And anyone in the world with Internet access can see my design. Super cool!</p>

          <p>Becoming a web developer will allow me to apply my passion for design, curiosity for engineering, and drive for precision in cutting edge ways. Doing so, I know I will feel a heightened sense of purpose and increased life satisfaction.</p>

          <h5>Role Modeling</h5>

          <p>As the mother of two daughters, I've made sure they've had strong female role models throughout their lives, something first modeled for me by my mother. And as the years have gone by, I've worked to be such a role model myself. I took charge of a major remodel of our house and in the process learned how to complete a plumbing overhaul, update nob & tube electrical wiring, and install appliances like a tankless water heater. Being a woman in the tech industry is another way for me to be a strong female role model.</p>
